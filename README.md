## project structure
The `reports` folder is used the base output folder by the clone detector program.  
Both JSON and TXT files can be found here.
The TXT files contain information that summarizes a run of clone detection algorithm for a particular project with a particular configurable `thresholdSize`.
The JSON files are used by the front end to display the visualizations.

The `projects` folder contains some, but not all, of the projects that were used to detect clones on.
